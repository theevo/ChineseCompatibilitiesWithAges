    - ðŸ”¥ calculate animal distances[^1]
        - âœ… Î”(Dragon, Rat) = [4, -8] 
        - âœ… Î”(Rat, Dragon) = [-4, 8]
        - âœ… Î”(Rat, Rat) = [-12, 0, 12]
        - ðŸ”¥ Î”(Pig, Rat) = [11, -1]


[^1]: Should years *older* be denoted as positive or negative? Why positive: calculating the distance is simple subtraction of the years of birth. `Goat 1991 - Tiger 1986 = 5; Goat 1991 - Tiger 1998 = -7`. Why negative: simply add the distance value to the base year. `Goat 1991 + -5 = Tiger 1986; Goat 1991 + 7 = Tiger 1998`. Why positive: IMO someone who is 2 years older than me is seen coloquially to be a positive number. I simply add 2 to my age to get their age. Conversely, for someone 2 years younger than me, I would subtract 2 years from my age (in essence, this would be a negative number).
